# AWS CLOUD SOLUTION FOR 2 COMPANY WEBSITES USING A REVERSE PROXY TECHNOLOGY

In this project, I will be building a secure infastructure in AWS VPC [Virtual Private Clound] for  BWL. This company uses wordpress CMS for its main business website and and a Tooling Website for their DevOps team. As part of the company’s desire for improved security and performance, a decision has been made to use a reverse proxy technology from NGINX to achieve this.

The area of focus for this project are Cost, Security, and Scalability . Hence, implementing the architecture designed below, ensure that infrastructure for both websites, WordPress and Tooling, is resilient to Web Server’s failures, can accommodate to increased traffic and, at the same time, has reasonable cost.
