  ## SECTION 1- CONFIGURATION OF THE NETWORK SERVICES 

 ## SET UP VPC

* I created a VPC named "mbarokah" as an isolated network environment 
## Note
* By default,the DNS hostname is disabled. 
* I enabled the DNS hostname.
 ![vpc settings](Images/vpc-settings.jpg)
 ![Dns-Hostname](Images/Dns-Hostname.JPG)


 # CREATE SUBNETS
 * subnets were added to the vpc to enable range of AWS resources to be deployed in the VPC
 * For context, 6 subnets were added [2 Public Subnets] [4 Private Subnets]
 * These subnets will exist within 2 avaialbiltiy zones [A and B]. That is, 3 subnets in each availabilty zone.
 * 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR consists of 65,536 IP V4 addresses [2^(32-x)]. Where x=cidr notation.
 * I randomly picked 6 IPV4 addresses within the 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block.
  ![Subnets](Images/Subnets.JPG)

  ## CREATE ROUTE TABLES FOR THE SUBNETS
  * 2 Route Tables were created. 1 for each group of subnets [Private and Public]
  
    ![Route-Table](Images/Route-Table.JPG)

   ##Â CREATE INTERNET GATEWAY

   * I created internet gateway and it was enabled and attached to the VPC

     ![Igw](Images/Igw.JPG)

     ## CONFIGURE A PUBLIC ROUTE TABLE

     * I edited the public route table created from ealier.
     * I associated the Internet Gateway to this route table.
     * The purpose of this is to be able to route the subnets in these group to the internet.
     * These action is not done for the Private RT.

  ![Public-RT](Images/Public-RT.JPG)

  ## CREATE ELASTIC IP ADDRESSES

  * I created 3 Elastic IPS .
      
   ![Elastic-IP](Images/Elastic-IP.JPG)
      
 ## CREATE NAT GATEWAY

 * I configured a NAT Gateway for connectivity to the internet
 * An elastic IP address was attached to this NAT Gateway at creation.
 * One of the public Subnets created earlier was also attached.

    ![NAT](Images/NAT.JPG)

    ## SECTION 2 - SET UP OF THE SECURITY 

     ## CREATE SECURITY GROUP
     ## 1. Nginx Server
     * Traffic will only be allowed from external load balancer from port 80 and 443 
      * It will allow SSH access from our Bastion

       
  ![NginxSG](Images/Nginx-SG.JPG)

 ## 2. External Application Load Balancer
    * ALB will be available from the internet
    * This will allow traffic from any IP addreas
    * Open port 80 and 443 from 0.0.0.0/0


   ![External-lb](Images/External-lb.JPG)


 
   ![External-SG](Images/External-SG.JPG)

   ## 3. Bastion Server

     * I onfigured the security group to allow SSH (Port 22) from my IP address only.         
    
   ![Bastion-SG](Images/Bastion-SG.JPG)
  
     ## 4. Internal Load Balancer

   * I configures this security gruop to only allow traffic from the nginx server.
   * Allowing Port 80/443 access from Nginx sg

   ![Internal-SG.](Images/Internal-SG.JPG)

   ![Internal-SG2.](Images/Internal-SG2.JPG)

  ## 5. Data-Layer Security Groups
                 
   This layer comprises of two segments and was configured accordingly.

  ## a. Relational Database Server

   * Only traffic from webservers and bastion servers were alllowed in this layer.
        
## b. Elastic File System (EFS)

     * Nginx and Webservers will have access to EFS Mountpoint

   ![Database-SG](Images/Database-SG.JPEG)
   ![Database-SG2](Images/Database-SG2.JPG)

 ## Section 3 - TLS Certificates From Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)
    * The TLS certificate is needed to handle secured connectivity to the application laodbalancer
    * I navigated to Amazon certificate manager 
    * I requested a public certificate 'mbarokah.website' 
    * Validate the certificate

   ![AWS-ACM](Images/AWS-ACM.JPG)

   ## Section 4 - Configuring Elastic File System

   * I created a file system within the vpc

   [Network Access]
   * For network access ,I customized mount targets which are  webservers in private subnet 1 and private subnet 2 in 2 availability zones.The mount target needs to be in the same subnet as the resource that needs to access it
   ![/Mount-Target.](Images/Mount-Target.JPG)

    [Access point]
      * On the EFS setup, created two access points for both tooling and wordpress applications

   ![Aceess-Point](Images/Aceess-Point.JPG)

  ## RDS SET-UP

    [CREATE KMS KEY]

  * I created a Key Management System key that will be used to encrypt the database

    [CREATE SUBNET GROUP]

  * Created a subnet group and added 2 private subnets (data Layer)
   ![RDS-Subnet](Images/RDS-Subnet.JPG) 

    [CREATE DATABSAE]
   * creation method: Standard create

   * Engine options: MySQL

   * Edition: MySQL Community

   * Version: 8.0.28

   ![RDS](Images/RDS.JPG)

 ## Section 5 - Configuring Compute Resources
  
  [CREATE AMI]
  I spinned up 3 Red-hat based instances.[Nginx] [Bastion] [Webservers]

   yum install wget vim python3 telnet htop git mysql net-tools chrony -y

   systemctl start chronyd

   systemctl enable chronyd

       ## SECTION 6 - Create AMI's from the instances

      * I created AMI for each of thr instances
   
 ![Nginx-AMI](Images/Nginx-AMI.JPG)

        ## SECTION 7 - Create Target Group

     Created traget groups Nginx and the servers behind the loadbalance [Tooling and Wordpress]
     * Below is the configuration.
      -- Target Type: Instance   

     -- Port https 443

     -- Protocol version http1

     -- Healthcheck path: /healthstatus

     -- Tag: acme-tooling-target -- Next

  ![TargetGroup.](Images/TargetGroup.JPG)

   ## SECTION 7 - CONFIGURE APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER (ALB)

   Nginx EC2 Instances will have configurations that accepts incoming traffic only from Load Balancers. No request should go directly to Nginx servers. With this kind of setup, we will benefit from intelligent routing of requests from the ALB to Nginx servers across the 2 Availability Zones. We will also be able to offload SSL/TLS certificates on the ALB instead of Nginx. Therefore, Nginx will be able to perform faster since it will not require extra compute resources to valifate certificates for every request.

   * Created Internal Application Loadbalancer

     - listens on HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443)
     - created within the appropriate VPC | AZ | Subnets
     - Choosing the Certificate already created from ACM
     - Selected Security Group for the internal load balancer
     - Selected wordpress Instance as the target group


   ![INTERNAL-ALB.](Images/iNTERNAL-ALB.JPG)
   * Created External[Internet-Facing] Application Loadbalancer

     - listens on HTTPS protocol (TCP port 443)
     - created within the appropriate VPC | AZ | Subnets
     - Choosing the Certificate already created from ACM
     - Selected Security Group for the external load balancer
     - Selected Nginx Instances as the target group

     ![EXTERNAL-ALB.](Images/EXTERNAL-ALB.JPG)

     * Route traffic coming from the nginx server into the internal loadbalancer by sending traffic to the respective target group based on the url being requested by the user.This should be done for both tooling and wordpress servers.
